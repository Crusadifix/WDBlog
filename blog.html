			<li>What challenges or troubles did you have completing this assignment. How did you solve them?
				<ul><li>I had no trouble completing the assignment, and thus no solutions.</li></ul></li>
			<li>What did you learn from this assignment? What did you already know?
				<ul><li>I learned everything other than headers, paragraphs, and images.</li></ul></li>
			<li>What resources (e.g. specific web articles, the class Piazza forum, the TAs) were most helpful in completing this assignment? How did you use these resources?
				<ul><li>My notes from class. I looked at what I had written down, and then applied it. </li></ul></li>

		<ul>
			<li>What was challenging about the assignment, and what specific kinds of problems did you have. How did you solve those problems?
				<ul><li>I had difficulty matching my page to the images when using my workstation, as they were too low-resolution. I solved it by resizing things and changing zoom levels. That said, 4k images would be nice in the future.</li></ul></li>
			<li>What did you learn from the assignment? Were there any special insights you had? What did you find that you already knew?
				<ul><li>I learned that perfectly remaking a design from an image is a pain in the neck. Also, I learned flex items do not interact with line breaks.</li></ul></li>
			<li>What kinds of resources were helpful for completing the assignment? Specific websites? Lectures? The class Piazza forum? The TAs? How did you use each of these resources?
				<ul><li>www.w3schools.com was extremely useful. I used it to double check how to use properties I was less familiar with.</li></ul></li>
			<li>What are one or two things you had to Google to complete the assignment?
				<ul><li>Setting a max number of flex elements displayed in a row. </li></ul></li>

		<ul>
			<li>What was challenging about the assignment, and what specific kinds of problems did you have.  How did you solve those problems?
				<ul><li>There were children of the twitContainer that had no data and were not visible -- they made scripting much more difficult than normal... until I removed them.</li></ul></li>
			<li>What did you learn from the assignment? Were there any special insights you had? What did you find that you already knew?
				<ul><li>If something is giving you trouble, consider removing it before deciding to work around it.</li></ul></li>
			<li>What kinds of resources were helpful for completing the assignment? Specific websites? Lectures? The class Piazza forum? The TAs? How did you use each of these resources?
				<ul><li>As usual, www.w3schools.com was extremely useful for double-checking how certain properties work.</li></ul></li>
			<li>What are one or two things you had to Google to complete the assignment?
				<ul><li>I googled a lot of shenanigans before I ended up reworking my code. Long story short, "phantom children" (as I like to call them) are a nightmare.</li></ul></li>
